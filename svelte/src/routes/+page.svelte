    <p>
    Welcome to my Doom site.
    </p>
    <p>
    I thought I'd take advantage of the <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="Github Pages" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> feature for my Doom stuff repo and add a website front-end.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm a 50-something father of 2, metalhead biker who has been playing Doom on and off since the shareware release first came out in 1993... I have tinkered with level-editing a little back in the day,
     but have not done any for about 25 years until I started again in early 2020 when furloughed due to the COVID-19 crisis.
     </p>
     <p>
         I have also been active on the <a href="https://www.doomworld.com">Doomworld</a> site since late 2019.
     </p>
     <p>I am a coder by trade and after discovering the possibilities of Decorate, ACS etc. for extending and 
     customising the base functionality of Doom, I was keen to experiment with such features.</p>
     <p>
    This site therefore presents my Doom map making adventures...
